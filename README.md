# DS_Interview_Notes
This note is the official write-up of my personal notes for preparing for interviews for Data Scientist positions. 

Remember that this note is not self-contained (yet), therefore it may not fit perfectly into your knowledge system. There are some concepts I missed out, for instance Bayesian Formula, Cross Validation, etc. This note will be beneficial to the reader who already has built the knowledge system of statistics, machine learning, and are looking for a quick summary and review before the interviews.

I am more than welcome for any comments and suggestions. Please email: huxuntao AT gmail.com. Thank you very much!
